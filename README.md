I have embarked on a journey to enhance my computer science knowledge by following the Open Source Society University (OSSU) track. OSSU offers a comprehensive curriculum that covers the core concepts and skills in computer science, equivalent to those taught in a traditional university program.

# Why OSSU?
Open Source: The curriculum is freely available and based on open educational resources.
Comprehensive: It includes all essential computer science courses, such as algorithms, data structures, databases, networking, and more.
Self-paced: I can learn at my own pace, allowing me to balance my studies with other commitments.
Community: I am part of a global community of learners and developers who support and motivate each other.

# Courses Completed:
[Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python]
