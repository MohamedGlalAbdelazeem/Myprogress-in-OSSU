# Indoor Voice
"""
In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in 
Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs 
that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace
 should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required,
  to prompt the user explicitly, 
as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
"""
# str = input("please Enter your string").lower()
# print(str)
